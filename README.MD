This is a script for [OpenBB](https://github.com/OpenBB-finance/OpenBBTerminal) which creates images following the instruction of WifeyAlpha, a bespoken FinTwit account, who was kind enough to list a bunch of meaningful numbers.

You will need API keys:
 - FRED https://fredaccount.stlouisfed.org/apikey
 - REDDIT https://www.reddit.com/wiki/api/ 
 - POLYGON https://polygon.io/stocks


## TODO

 - gold cannot be exported alone
 - find a proxy for retail investment activity (for now AMC?)
 - find a proxy for Zombie Banks
 - Deflators should be rebased for clarity, they start at 100 in different years
